        <h1><b>Alignment Of
Organizational Strategy<br>
With Information
Technology Strategy</b></h1><br>
        
            <h4><b>Introduction<hr></b></h4>
            <p>            
<br>Digital computers came into being after the Second World War. After a period
of use solely in scientific and military areas, business perceived that this
technological innovation could be very useful. The large, expensive equipment
was very limited in terms of the information it could process and store, in
addition to the restricted number of users who could access them simultaneously or from remote locations. Both the training and vision of professionals
in the area of what was then called “data processing” was eminently technical.
Thus, the early applications were developed to resolve well-structured problems, i.e., those whose stages and sequences were well-defined, such as
                payroll, stock control, and accounts due and received.<br>
Technology evolved and by the end of the 1970s, there were a number of
alternative uses for computers and basic applications had been installed in the
large companies. At that point, specialists began discussing a way to use
        
        
        
       Information Technology (IT), a term that came into use in the 1980s, better to
make businesses more competitive. From that time on, many theories, models,
and techniques have been studied and developed so that information technology can be used in tune with business strategies and operations.<br>
IT progressively came to play an important role in the strategy of the leading
companies in competitive markets.<br>
Presently there are great expectations that IT applications will make possible
new strategy alternatives for business and new opportunities for companies; as
in the case of e-commerce and e-business (Porter, 2001; Evans & Wurster,
1999). However, there is also an extensive debate about the real gains derived
from investments in IT. Focusing solely on the efficiency of IT applications will
not provide a response to such questions. To evaluate the impact of IT on
business strategy and operations, a focus on its effectiveness is needed. One
must examine the results of IT applications in relation to the objectives, goals,
and needs of an organization. Effectiveness should be maintained in the long
run, and for this to happen, the concept of Strategic Alignment between IT and
the business is fundamental.<br>
The efficacious use of IT and the integration of IT strategy and business strategy
extends beyond the concept of IT as a tool for productivity, which is often a
factor critical to success. Today, the route to such success is no longer related
just to the hardware and software employed, or even to development methodologies, but with the alignment of IT with the companies’ strategies, characteristics and organizational structure.<br>
                <br><br>In the words of Rockart et al. (1996):<br><br></p>
<p class="p1">"In sum, the load on IT organizations is heavier than ever before,
    and the management of IT is more complex."´</p>
Therefore, this approach is the subject of the present chapter, which aims at
elucidating the main points that transform IT into a real tool for the competitiveness of organizations’ business strategies.<br> 
        
        
            <h3><b>Conceptualizing Information Technology</b></h3><hr>
            <h4><b>What is <em>Information Technology,</em> after all?</b></h4><hr>
The concept ofInformation Technology is more inclusive than those of data
processing, information systems, software engineering, information science, or
the set of hardware and software programs, since it also involves human,
administrative and organizational dimensions (Keen, 1993).<br>
Some authors, such as Alter (1992), distinguish between Information Technology and Information Systems, restricting the former to technical aspects,
while the latter correspond to issues related to the flow of work and the people
and information involved. Other authors, however, use the term information
technology to include both aspects, and such is the view of Henderson and
Venkatraman (1993).<br>
According to Porter and Millar (1985), IT should be understood in a broad way
“to include all information that is created and utilized by business, and thus as
the broad spectrum of technologies which are increasingly convergent and
interconnected, that process this information. In addition to computers, therefore, data recognition equipment, technologies for communication, industrial
automation and other hardware and services are involved”. Thus, in this
chapter, the more inclusive term Information Technology (IT), which includes
information systems, the use of hardware and software, telecommunications,
automation, and multimedia resources utilized by organizations to provide data
and knowledge will be used (Luftman et al., 1993; Weil, 1992).
            <h3><b>The “Productivity Paradox”,</b></h3><hr>
In recent years, both the expectations around and the debate about the role of
IT have grown in academic publications, those devoted to executive and
business people and publications for the general public. On the one hand, there
have been questions about the results derived from investments in IT. On the
other, there is a kind of “enchantment” with IT applications making it possible
to activate mechanisms in the so-called “globalized economy”, and especially
those known as e-commerce and e-business (Porter, 2001; Tapscott, 2001;
            Evans & Wurster, 1999; Frontini, 1999). 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        IT evolved from its traditional orientation toward administrative support to a
strategic role within organizations. The vision of IT as a strategic competitive
weapon has been discussed and emphasized, since IT not only sustains existing
business operations, but also allows new business strategies to become viable.<br>
Despite this, according to many authors (among them Henderson &
Venkatraman, 1993), when the aggregated global economy is considered, a
big doubt hovers around the existence of proof of significant gains in productivity due to the utilization of IT. This is what many refer to as the “IT
productivity paradox” or the computer paradox (Landauer and Solow apud
Willcocks & Lester, 1997; Brynjolfsson, 1993; Strassman, 1990). This debate
also often comes up in the business world.<br>
Recently the ideas of Carr (2003) have had a heavy and controversial
repercussion. He defends the hypothesis that IT in itself has no strategic value,
since its dissemination is so extensive that it is not possible to seek differentiation through it, and that what makes a resource truly strategic, is not it ubiquity,
but its scarceness. Thus, since the basic functions of IT are available and
accessible to all, their power and omnipresence have begun to transform them
from potentially strategic resources into “commoditized” productions elements.<br>
Nevertheless some hypotheses have been advance to explain the paradox
involving investments in IT (Brynjolfsson, 1993):<br><br>
            • &emsp;<b>Errors in productivity measures.</b> The productivity of IT use is usually
measured poorly, and this is true for “inputs” (investments) as well as the
“outputs” (benefits). The greater problems of appropriate measurement
reside in the latter and there are special difficulties in the services sector
and the work of white-collar professionals. IT characteristics related to
quality, variety, customer service, speed, and response are particularly
hard to measure.<br>
            • &emsp;<b>Lag time between IT investments and benefits.</b> The benefits deriving
from the use of IT can take years to appear. This is due to the need to
accumulate experience in order to fully enjoy the potential of IT.<br>
            •&emsp;<b> Redistribution</b>. IT can be a factor in productivity gains for an isolated
company, but not for the overall set of companies in an industry. Under
these circumstances, profits and participation in the market can be
redistributed, but the size of this market cannot be altered. This could lead
IT to modify the minimum requirements for participation in this market.<br>
        
        
            •&emsp;<b> Bad IT management.</b> There are deficiencies in IT effectiveness evaluation practices and reasons on the order of internal company policies that
can lead to a lack of gains with the use of IT.<br><br>
One example of the problems in measuring IT productivity is the implantation
of automatic bank tellers. When ATMs (automatic teller machines) were
installed, people often stopped using checks. If there were a measure of
productivity in the bank related to the number of check processed, a drop in
revenues would be detected! The gains in client convenience resulting from the
service, however, are hard to measure. In addition, it is just as hard, or even
more so, to measure how much the bank profits with the increased customer
satisfaction derived from this convenience.<br>
It is emphasized that this debate about the return on IT investment is also taking
place on the inside of companies.<br>
According to Henderson and Venkatraman (1993), this lack of ability on the
part of companies to obtain considerable return on their investment in IT is due
(although not completely) to a lack of coordination and alignment of the
strategies for business and for IT. This adjustment between business strategy,
IT, and the internal structures of the company, with a view to it positioning and
activity in the market is not an isolated event or one that is easy to obtain, but
a dynamic process and one that continues over time.<br>
Thus it can be stated that no application of IT, considered in isolation, for as
sophisticated as it might be, can maintain a competitive advantage. This can
only be obtained by the ability of the company to strategically exploit IT in a
continuous way.<br><br><br>
<h3><b>The Efficiency and Effectiveness of
Information Technology Applications</b></h3><hr><br>
The concepts of efficiency and effectiveness are very useful to an understanding
of the role of IT in organizations (Laurindo, Carvalho & Shimizu, 2003;
Maggiolini, 1981).<br>
Usually, efficiency means making good use of things, while effectiveness means
doing the right things. Efficiency is related to the use of resources, while
        
        
        
        effectiveness is related to meeting goals, objectives, and requirement. Efficiency is related to aspects internal to IT activity and the adequate use of
resources, while effectiveness compares the results of IT applications with the
results of the company’s business and possible impacts on its operations and
structure. To be efficacious in IT means using it to leverage the company’s
business, making it more competitive (Figure 5.1).<br><br>
            <h3><b>Critical Success Factors (CSF)</b></h3><hr><br>
One of the first attempts to link the use of IT to companies’ objectives and
strategies arose at the end of the 1970s, and was proposed by Rockart (1979):
the Critical Success Factor (CSF) method which is still widely used today to
plan and prioritize IT applications. Rockart was seeking to resolve the problem
of formulating managerial information systems.<br>
According to this method, managerial information systems and those that
produce performance indicators for a company should be based on the
executive’s own definitions of the information needs. The focus of the proposed
approach is in the CSF, which “are a limited number of areas in which results,
if satisfactory, guarantee the organization’s successful competitive performance.”<br><br>
            
            
            <em>Figure 5.1. Efficiency and effectiveness of an information system (adapted
from Maggiolini, 1981)</em><br><br>
            
            <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(37).png"><br><br>
            
            
            
            For Rockart, the main origins of CSF are: the structure of the industry, the
competitive strategy, the positioning of the company within the industry, its
geographic location, the environment, and circumstantial factors.<br>
Basically, the CSF method includes an analysis of the industry in which the
company is inserted, as well as its strategy, methods, and competitors. This
analysis is followed by two or three interview sessions with the executives,
aimed at identifying the CSF, indicating their relationship to the company’s
business objectives, and defining their respective qualitative or quantitative
indicators. Finally, the information systems to control the CSF are defined,
along with their indicators.<br>
For Rockart, this process can be useful for each level of the company and
should be repeated periodically, since the CSF change over time and can be
different from one individual to another.<br>
Despite its being conceived originally to design information systems and
especially managerial and executive information systems, the CSF method had
an important impact on managerial practices and strategic planning. Beyond its
utilization in planning information systems and in administering IT projects, it
has been used in the strategic planning of business and in the implementation of
strategies, in managing changes and as a competitive analysis technique
(Pollalis & Frieze, 1993). This method takes an approach based in directives,
through focusing on the essential issues of companies. Further, the continuous
measurement of CSF allows companies to identify strengths and weaknesses
in their main departments, processes, and functions (Rockart, 1979; Sullivan,
1985; Rockart & Crescenzi, 1984; Martin, 1982).<br>
Even though it is not a complete methodology since it leaves gaps with regard
to transnational information systems, there is agreement that it is very useful in
developing managerial information systems. It allows a vision of the means and
alternatives for improving the functions and areas of crucial importance to the
company, and makes the connection between information systems and the
company’s business clearer.<br>
A proposal similar to Rockart’s CSF model was developed by Broadbent and
Weil (1997), who proposed a model called “Management by Maxim” which
analyzes and defines the main principles which should guide the business and
IT of each company. With this, it is possible to define the infrastructure and IT
services that would combine with the company’s competitive and strategic
positioning<br>
            
            
            
            The <em>Balanced Scorecard,</em> developed by Kaplan and Norton (1992), is, in a
certain fashion, a more systematic extension of the CSF idea. It is a method for
measuring and directing company activities in accordance with its strategy. The
method uses four sets of interconnected measurements, each of which focuses
on a perspective: the financial, that of the client, that of innovation and learning,
and the perspective internal to the business. Each of these perspectives has its
own set of goals and measures.
Even though the Balanced Scorecard is not an especially focused method for
IT planning, it has direct implications for the definition of information systems
with potential strategic impact. Willcocks and Lester (1997), among others,
suggest using theBalanced Scorecard in the strategic planning of IT, especially
in the phases of development and implementation.<br><br>
            <h3><b>The Strategic Role of IT Applications</b></h3><hr>
McFarlan’s (1984) strategic Grid allows us to visualize how IT is related to
strategy and to business operations in a company. This model analyzes the
present and future impact of IT applications on the business, defining four
“quadrants” (Figure 5.2), each of which represents a situation for the company:
“Support”, “Factory”, “Transition”, and “Strategy” (see also Fernades &
Kugler, 1990).
<br><br><br>
        <em>Figure 5.2. ³Strategic Grid´: Strategic impact of IT applications (adapted
from McFarlan, 1984)</em>
        <br><br>
        
        <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(38).png"><br><br>
        
        
        “Support”: IT has little influence on present and future company strategies.
There is no need for a highlighted positioning for the IT area in the company
hierarchy. Usually this is what happens in a traditional manufacturing company.<br>
“Factory”: the existing IT applications contribute decisively to the company’s
success, but new applications with strategic impact are not contemplated. The
IT department should be situated at a high level of hierarchy. The classic
example is the case of airline companies, which depend on their ticket
reservation systems, but new developments just update these applications.<br>
“Transition”: IT moves from a more discrete position (in the “support”
quadrant) to one of greater visibility in the company strategy. The IT area tends
toward a position of greater importance in the company’s hierarchy. The
example usually cited in the literature is electronic publishing. Today, ecommerce displays the same profile. From occupying a role in operational
support in commercial enterprises, it has become an agent for<br>
business transformation. “Strategic”: IT has great influence on the general
strategy of companies. Present as well as future applications are strategic and
affect the company’s business. In this case, it is important that IT be positioned
at a high level of hierarchy. IT has a strategic role in banks for instance.<br>
To evaluate the strategic impact of IT, McFarlan (1984) proposed an analysis
of five basic questions about IT applications, related to the forces of competition forces (Porter, 1979):<br><br>
• &emsp;Can IT establish entry barriers for market competitors?<br>
• &emsp;Can IT influence the change of suppliers as well as alter bargaining power?<br>
• &emsp;Can IT change the basis of competition (based on cost, differentiation, or
focus)?<br>
• &emsp;Can IT alter bargaining power in relationships with buyers?<br>
• &emsp;Can IT generate new products?<br><br>
These questions serve to guide executives in their search for new competitive
advantages through IT, whether it is in their internal organization or in their
relationship with other companies or their customers. These questions can be
used to orient the strategic use of IT, aiming at the creation of new interrelationship among companies, such as forming partnership or cooperative
networks.
        
        In this way, the strategic importance of IT can vary from one industry to another
and also among companies in the same industry.<br>
IT has played an important role in the strategy of the leading companies in
competitive markets. Two matters are basic to an understanding of the role of
IT: obtaining advantages over competitors all along the value chain (Porter &
Millar, 1985), and the creation and reinforcement of essential competencies
(Duhan et al., 2001).<br>
The concern with regard to the value chain is in understanding how IT can
increase competitive advantages by cost reduction, constructing entry barriers,
and strengthening the company’s relations with suppliers and consumers. With
regard to essential competencies, the focus of concern is on resources. Thus,
competitive advantages are born of the ability to accumulate capacities and
resources that are rare, valuable and hard to imitate.<br>
Porter and Miller (1985) highlight the concepts of the value chain (activities
inside the company linked by connections and which have one physical
component and another of information processing) and value systems (the set
of value chains of an industry from the suppliers to the final consumer).<br><br>

        <em>Figure 5.3. IT applications along the value chain (adapted from Porter &
Millar, 1985)</em>
                
 <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(39).png"><br><br>
        
        IT permeates the chains of value, changing the way of executing activities of
value and also the nature of the connections among them. In doing so, IT can
affect competition in three possible ways:<br><br><br>
• &emsp;by changing the structure of the sector since it has the ability to influence
each of the five forces of competition (Porter, 1979);<br>
• &emsp;by creating new competitive advantages, reducing costs, increasing
differentiation, and altering the scope of competition scope;<br>
• &emsp;by generating completely new business.<br><br>
In Figure 5.3 there are examples of IT applications according to the nine generic
middle activities and the generic end activities presented along the value chain.
The impact on the value system will be studied in the chapter on the New
Economy.<br>
The potential that IT has to make these changes varies according to the
characteristics of the process (value chain) and the product, with reference to
information needs. The “Information intensity matrix” considers the value chain
and analyzes “how much” information is contained in the process and the
product (see Figure 5.4). In companies whose products and processes contain
a lot of information, the information system will be very important (Porter &
Miller, 1985).<br>
In their original article, Porter and Millar, (1985) did not cite an example for
“high information content in the product” or “low information intensity in the
process”, a position which is corroborated by Doyle (1991). However, for<br><br>

        <em>Figure 5.4. Information intensity matrix (adapted from Porter & Millar,
1985)</em><br><br>
            
            
            <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(40).png"><br><br>
        
        
        Ward (1988), this would be the case of educational and law firms; for Duhan
et al. (2001), consulting firms would also fit in this same quadrant.<br>
Further, according Dunah et. al. (2001), an analysis of the value chain would
be impaired in the case of knowledge based companies (such as consulting
firms) where it is hard to identify the value that is aggregated to each activity.
In these situations, the authors propose that using the essential competencies
of Prahalad and Hamel (1990) would be more appropriate to plan the strategic
use of information systems.<br><br><br>
            <h3><b>Strategic Alignment</b></h3><hr><br>
Henderson and Venkatraman (1993) proposed a model that emphasizes and
analyzes the strategic importance of the role performed by IT inside companies.
The proposed model is based on factors inside and outside the company. IT
impacts on the company’s business and how these affect its organization and
IT strategy are analyzed, along with what is available in the market in terms of
new technologies. This proposal is called the “Strategic Alignment Model.”<br>
Henderson and Venkatraman also propose that I addition to the widely
recognized need for an adjustment between the company’s strategy and its
internal structure, it should analogously have made adjustments between the
external IT strategy (positioning in the IT market) and the internal structure of
its information systems (their organization and administration).<br>
Therefore, according to this model, in order to plan IT, the external factors
(strategy) and internal factors (infrastructure) that should be considered are:
negotiating strategy, IT strategy, organizational infrastructure and processes, and the infrastructure of information systems and processes.
Another premise of the Model for Strategic Alignment is that an efficacious
administration of IT requires a balance among the decisions in all four factors
listed above. The model highlights two types of integration between the
domains of business and IT: the strategic and operational.<br>
This model’s novelty is that it considers that IT strategy can change a
company’s business strategy, when usually the business strategy is considered
as the starting point for IT planning. Planning has to a continuous process, since
external factors are constantly changing. If the company does not accompany
these changes, it can be seriously impaired in the sharp competition for markets.
        <br>
        This is particularly true when a new technology is adopted by almost all
companies in a sector of activity and thus it is no longer an element of
competitive advantage for the user and becomes a factor of disadvantage for
the nonuser.<br><br>
            <h3><b>The Perspectives for Strategic Alignment</b></h3><hr><br>
Henderson and Venkatraman (1993), and Luftman et al. (1993) point to four
main perspectives on strategic alignment, taking as their start point either the
negotiating strategy or IT strategy as the driver of this process:<br><br>
            1.<b> Executing the strategy</b><br><br>
            <em>Business Strategy "Business Structure " IT Structure</em><br><br>
This is the most widely disseminated and best understood perspective
since it corresponds to the classical model of a hierarchical vision of
strategic administration. As an example, we cite the case of the publisher
McGraw Hill whose strategy for publishing books on order for American
universities required support from an IT application.<br><br>
            2. <b>Technological transformation</b><br><br>
            <em>Business Strategy " IT Strategy " IT </em><br><br>
From this perspective, note that the IT structure is not limited by the
structure of the organization of business. The negotiating strategy requires
new IT strategies (including new competencies) to be implemented. This

        <em>Table 5.1. Characteristics of the strategic alignment perspectives (adapted
            from Henderson & Venkatraman, 1993)</em>
            
            
            
            <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(41).png"><br><br>
            
            
            perspective can be illustrated by the case of a traditional bookstore (such
as Siciliano, Saraiva, or Cultura) which, when setting up a computerized
“megastore” or an internet site, needs a new IT strategy, since formerly
this resource had not been used so intensely.<br><br>
            3. <b>Competitive potential</b><br>
            <em>IT strategy " Business Strategy " Business Structure</em><br><br>
The choice of business strategy derives from the new IT strategy adopted.
The typical example of this perspective is companies that are born as pure
players on the Internet (like Amazon.com). There was an IT strategy (to
dominate the Internet) and it made the business strategy that made use of
this IT strategy viable.<br><br>
            4. <b>Services level</b><br><br>
            <em>IT Strategy " IT Structure " Business Structure</em><br><br>
This perspective aims at serving a world class clientele in Information
System services. It can be exemplified by companies that outsource IT
services such as Kodak and British Petroleum.<br><br>
Table 5.1 shows the role of company management and the role of IT as well as
the respective basic criteria to evaluate performance for each of these perspectives. Note that the role of the managers changes, which results in different
abilities. Figure 5.5 shows a schematic for the flow of the alignment process
from each of the four perspectives.<br><br>
            
         <em>Figure 5.5. Perspectives on strategic alignment (adapted from Henderson
& Venkatraman, 1993)</em>   
            
             
            <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(42).png"><br><br>
            
            Luftman (1996) also proposed that in some situations there could be a merger
of two perspectives. In these cases, two perspectives are identified as
occurring simultaneously; they have the same starting and arrival points, but run
different routes.<br>
Some research has suggested factors, which, when present along with good
performance, work as enablers of strategic alignment. Luftman (2001) listed
five of these factors: support of senior executives for IT, involvement of IT in
the development of strategy, understanding IT in the company’s business,
partnership between business and IT, well-prioritized design of IT and, IT
exercising leadership. On the other hand, the absence or poor performance of
these factors is considered inhibitors of strategic alignment.<br>
Prairie (1996), in turn, studied the critical points for the use of IT that lead to
leveraging business:<br><br>
• &emsp;existence of a defined strategy;<br>
• &emsp;development of customer-centered measurements;<br>
• &emsp;fitting IT processes and capabilities to business objectives and the
insertion of business goals in IT processes and capabilities;<br>
• &emsp;finally, IT should be a matter of interest to all, not just to technicians.<br><br>
Even though the strategic alignment model was conceived for analyzing IT
strategy in organizations, its concepts can be very useful for the strategic
planning of relationships among companies, which are relationship among
companies enabled or potentialized by IT.<br>
As a complement, Weill and Ross (2002) highlight the importance of having
decisions about the use of IT involve the business people in the company, and
not just the IT team, so that business-strategy issues be contemplated. An
exclusively technical focus does not allow decision-making that leads to the use
of IT as a factor for competitive advantage.<br><br><br>
            <h3><b>Integrated Management Systems and Strategic Alignment</b></h3><hr>

Companies have often adopted solutions that encompass the entire range of the
company’s information systems: these are the Integrated Management Sys-
         tems, or as they are generally known, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning). The
intensity of resources needed to implement these systems has raised doubts
from the financial point of view about the return on these investments, as well
as their real strategic impact.<br>
ERP systems were born of the evolution of companies’ information needs.<br>
Initially, the appearance of MRP (Materials Requirements Planning), in the
1970s, allowed for the equation of problems to calculate production materials
for the mix of products whose structures contained a large number of components. MRP systems evolved to MRPII (Manufacturing Resources Planning), that had wider coverage, allowing for the inclusion of planning of other
aspects, such as Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP) to allow management of other resources (equipment, labor, etc.) in addition to materials. The
next step was to include various other aspects, in addition to the industrial
module (MRPII), such as accounting, finance, commercialization, human
resources, and engineering, among others. This new generation of systems was
named “ERP Systems,” generically called Business Management Systems
(Laurindo & Mesquita, 2000). The next evolution consisted of integrating IT
into the various stages of the supply chain, at first via EDI and presently via,
B2B (business-to-business) e-commerce (Laurindo et al., 2002). This subject
will be dealt with in the chapter on the New Economy.<br>
In its basic concept, ERP is an applications system that serves as the
“backbone” for the entire company. It integrates management and business
processes, providing a global view of the organization (Laurindo & Pessoa,
2001). It has the enormous benefit of providing the opportunity to have a single
database, a single application and a unified interface throughout the company
(Bingi et al., 1999). When systems are not integrated, information necessary for
operations can be repeated within several systems, a fact that creates problems
of lost, outdated and conflicting information. In large organizations, this is a very
sensitive problem.<br>
Integrating information systems has the built in advantage of broader inclusion
of the different business functions, which increased the company’s overall
performance. It also implicitly holds out the expectation that the ready-made
system (although there can be customization) will be less expensive than an
equally efficient and integrated system developed internally by a systems
architect.<br>
When the company is transnational with affiliates spread over various countries
on different continents, this advantage can be even more significant. There are
also great advantages when, due to the nature of its business, a company has
            
            
            a centralizing bias, whether strategic or cultural. In this case, in addition to
operational gains, there is the perspective of organizational gain from the
homogenization of operational practices and management forms.<br>
On the other hand, in implanting an ERP, the company is implicitly acquiring a
generic solution that has the best management practices built in from the point
of view of software providers. In many cases, this means a more efficient way
of working, but there are times when the company can lose important
differentiating techniques that make it more competitive than its rivals. Therefore, one needs to analyze whether the business practices included in the ERP
“package” coincide with the practices most appropriate to the particularities of
the business of the client company.<br>
In the case of Apple Computer, for example, the differentiation of its product
is so great and so clear that any homogenization of services resulting from
implanting an ERP would not mean a loss of competitiveness in relation to
competitors. However, for the majority of companies that produce microcomputers this is not the scenario, since their differentiation lies much more in
services and price than in the product itself. In these cases, implanting an ERP
implies the risk of a loss of differentiation (Davenport, 1998). Gains in
efficiency are obscured by the loss of effectiveness.<br>
Thus the integration of information systems, which permits a more efficient flow
of processes, does not necessarily result in the desired strategic alignment.<br><br>
            <h3><b>Routes to a Strategic Role for IT</b></h3><hr>
            <h4><b>The Debate about IT Strategic Planning</b></h4><hr>
There are authors who contest the need for strategic planning of IT due to the
intense rate of technological change and the patterns of competition in globalized markets (a matter which will be discussed in the chapter on the New
Economy). Some authors, like Ciborra (1998), state the strategic success of
IT applications might be achieved through a tentative approach, rather than
structured methods of strategic IT planning. These authors argue that frequently
the drivers of strategic IT applications are efficiency issues, instead of a result
of a strategic IT plan.<br>
Some well-known cases of successful information systems, with clear and
recognized strategic impact, do not show evidence of prior planning, which
            
            
            seems to corroborate with this line of thinking as studied by Eardley et al.
(1996).<br>
These authors developed a study in which they analyze eight “classics” of
strategic systems, whose histories of development, implantation and operation
have been sufficiently well documented. The systems studied were the following:<br><br>
• &emsp;American Airlines: Sabre (booking)<br>
•&emsp; United Airlines: Apollo (booking)<br>
• &emsp;American Hospital: Asap (Stock and order control)<br>
• &emsp;Federal Express: Cosmos (Routing/allocation)<br>
• &emsp;McKesson: Economost (Stock and order control for pharmacies)
• &emsp;Citicorp: GTN (Negócio Global - Global Trading, global investment
management)<br>
• &emsp;Merrill Lynch: CMA (Integrated Management of Investment Accounts)<br>
• &emsp;Philadelphia National Bank: MAC (Networks of shared Automatic Teller
Machines)<br><br>
To verify why the systems are called strategic, the authors looked for these
systems’ impact on each of Porter’s (1979) forces of competition, as shown in
Table 5.2<br><br>
            <em>Table 5.2. The Impact of ³classic´ cases of strategic information systems
on Porter¶s forces of competition (adapted from Eardley et al., 1996)</em>
            
            
            
            <br><br>
             <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(43).png"><br><br>
            
            
           In addition to finding no evidence that the strategic impact of these systems had
been previously planned (even though reinforced and exploited intensely after
realizing their strategic impact), another significant conclusion was that several
of these systems did not pass through the filter of a financial analysis with the
data available at the time they were developed.<br><br>
            <h4><b>Classifying Models that Analyze IT and Strategy</b></h4><hr>
Over the years, many authors have tried to contribute to the understanding and
construction of a process to transform IT into a real strategic tool.
Reviewing the various publications produced since the end of the 1970s,
generally the various models analyzed which deal with the role of IT in
organizations can be classified into four groups (Laurindo et al., 2001):<br><br>
 &emsp;Diagnostic models: provide instruments and criteria to diagnose the role
of IT in organizations;<br>
&emsp;Prescriptive models: are those that indicate benchmark standards to be
followed, or which report the best practices related to the strategic use of
IT;<br>
 &emsp;Models dedicated to action: indicate procedures for IT planning and
for the selection of IT applications to be developed in a way that will have
positive impact on the organizations’ performance;<br>
&emsp; Integrative models: are those that group various elements from the
above approaches to form a broader structure of analysis.<br><br>
Table 5.3 presents some examples of different models of each of the groups
above.<br><br>
<h4><b>The Issue of Efficiency and Effectiveness: What the
    Company Should Do</b></h4><hr><br>
Throughout this chapter the importance of focusing on the effectiveness of IT
utilization has been emphasized, since frequently analysis is done only from the
point of view of efficiency. However, this does not mean that being efficient is
not positive; it means that one needs to be efficient in certain areas. In other <br><br>
            
            <em>Table 5.3. Examples of models for analyzing the strategic role of IT
(adapted from Laurindo et al., 2001)</em>
            
            
            
            
             <br><br>
             <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(44).png"><br><br>
            
            
            words, once effectiveness is achieved, increased efficiency can result in
important gains.<br>
Figure 5.6 contains a proposed diagram for viewing the situations related to
efficiency and effectiveness in the use of IT.<br>
When companies demonstrate low efficiency and high effectiveness, they are
in “CHAOS” in a critical situation. The first move to get out of this situation
should be to aim at increased effectiveness, and to align the IT strategy with the
business strategy.<br>
If the company has low effectiveness, but high efficiency in the use of IT, it
means that it should redirect its efforts, and change the focus of its activities, in
order to use its good capacity where it can add value to the company’s
competitiveness.<br>
In the case of a company with high effectiveness, but low efficiency in IT
utilization, it is necessary to work to improve its processes, with a view to
exploiting to the maximum the focus that is already on the right things, and which
can contribute to the success of the company’s strategy.<br>
Finally, a company that is efficient and efficacious in the use of IT will arrive in
“Eden”, the ideal situation that should be the goal for all.<br><br>
<h4><b>Seeking the Most Important Points in IT’s Strategic
    Role</b></h4><hr><br><br>
Surveying various means of analyzing the strategic role of IT inside the
organizations points to the growing complexity of the issue, in response to the
increased strategic opportunities opened up by IT. Today, business and IT
strategies are often confused, especially with companies active on the Internet.<br>
Even though a large number of articles are devoted to analyzing the relationship
between IT and company strategy, this theme remains a fertile field for more
research, due to the dynamism of IT potentialities and to the new strategies for
the market.<br>
However, it is possible to list some points that allow for diverse approaches and
which therefore merit emphasis in IT use in alignment with business strategy:<br><br>
• &emsp;<b>The need to have a clear strategic vision for both business and IT,
to view IT as a competitive advantage for the business, and that it
            be dedicated to the market and to the IT user.</b>
            
            
            Having a clear strategic vision for business and for IT is the starting point
for making a significant impact on the organization’s performance. IT
needs to be seen as a means for the company to obtain competitive
advantages in the market. It needs to act in concert with the company’s
operations and strategy. Technological advances in themselves are not
justified without this vision.<br>
• <b>Competitive advantage resulting from IT management and its
            strategic alignment with the business and not from specific applications of IT.</b><br>
Various authors (Henderson & Venkatraman, 1993; Luftman et al.,
1993; Rockart et al., 1996; Willcocks & Lester, 1997; Luftman, 1996;
Avison et al., 1998) argue that it is not enough to have an IT strategy, it
has to be aligned with the business strategy of the company. Further, there
is a notion that this alignment should be developed and maintained over
time in a dynamic process. It is not possible to maintain a competitive
advantage with a specific IT application since it is increasingly easy to
copy this application and an increasing number of companies use common
software, such as, for example, ERP systems (Laurindo et al., 2002).
Only an advantage based on IT management aligned with the business
permits companies to maintain an advantage for a longer time.<br>
• <b>The importance of considering all the technical (including monitoring the evolution of what is available in the IT market) as well as the
            organizational aspects.</b><br>
As Henderson and Venkatraman (1993) stress, it is necessary for
organizations to pay attention to what is newly available in the IT market
and that there exist integration between its strategies and structures, both
of IT and the business.<br>
            • <b>Seeking effectiveness and not just efficiency.</b><br>
Even though it is recognized that there is a need for efficiency and high
technical capacity in IT operations, it is consensus that a company will only
be able to obtain competitive advantages by procuring effectiveness in the
use of IT as well. The search for IT effectiveness means analyzing its
impact on the results the company obtains, as well as considering gains in
productivity and the competitiveness of the business as measures of IT
effectiveness.<br>
            • <b>The need for a close and intense relationship between the executives of the IT and business areas.</b>
            <br>
            
            One of the most cited manners for obtaining strategic IT applications is the
existence of a good relationship between executives from the IT and
business areas. This means that there exist structures and procedures
aimed at strengthening and ensuring the continuity of this good relationship. In companies where IT has or is beginning to have a strategic role for
the business, the closeness of IT and business executives in the hierarchy
takes on greater importance (Li & Ye, 1999; Prairie, 1996; Rockart et al.,
1996; McFarlan, 1990; Willcocks & Lester, 1997; Earl & Feeny, 1994)
In addition there should be the realization that it is not a matter just for
technicians, but is an issue to be considered throughout the organization,
and especially by those who formulate and decide business strategy. In
turn, the IT executives should develop abilities in addition to technology
management; they also need to have a clear vision of the business.<br>
            • <b>Variable evaluation criteria according to the application.</b><br>
Given the many different strategies for business and IT, as well as the
different importance of IT in each organization, IT should be evaluated
based on several criteria (encompassing the technical, organizational, and
strategic aspects) and adapted to each company. Thus adopting a single
standard for evaluating the effectiveness of IT is not viable.<br>
•<b> Dynamic and flexible management of IT (as a continuous process)
            and of its evaluation.</b><br>
IT management (its strategy and planning) must be a continuous process,
not restricted to the “moment of planning”, but monitoring IT throughout
its life cycle. IT management should also be flexible enough to monitor
outside changes in terms of opportunities for business strategies and the
availability of IT.<br>
            • <b>The issue of the “productivity paradox.”</b><br>
The debate about whether productivity gains do result from IT still hovers
in the air; therefore, analyses to explain or deny it are becoming progressively broader.<br>
Productivity indicators (measures) for IT cannot be based solely on
technical and efficiency aspects; they must be connected to business
productivity measures that truly represent what is significant for the
company’s progress.<br><br>
            
            
            
            <h4><b>Trends in the Strategic Role of IT</b></h4><hr><br><br>
Researches had been developed in order to find the enablers of Strategic
Alignment. Luftman (2001) listed five of them: senior executive support for IT,
IT involved in strategy development, IT understands the business, business-IT
partnership, well-prioritized IT projects, and IT demonstrates leadership. The
absence or poor performance of these same factors is considered an inhibitor
of Strategic Alignment.<br>
Some authors, like Ciborra (1998), state the strategic success of IT applications might be achieved through a tentative approach, rather than structured
methods of strategic IT planning. These authors argue that frequently the
drivers of strategic IT applications are efficiency issues, instead of a result of
a strategic IT plan. Some important and well-known successful information
systems, with clear strategic impacts, do not present evidences of being
previously planned, what seems to be in agreement with this kind of thinking
(Eardley et al., 1996).<br>
What does the future hold for the role of IT in the strategy of organizations? At
present there are a series of applications that have captivated the attention of
many and have opened up new possibilities, just as there are new concerns.
Terms such as Knowledge Management and CRM (Customer Relationship
Management), have been much used and are strongly associated to IT. In fact,
without IT these concepts have difficulty becoming resources effectively used
in companies.<br>
Despite the failure of many virtual enterprises (the so-called “dot.coms”), ebusiness and e-commerce applications appear to have reached a new level of
maturity, especially B2B (business-to-business — the connection between
companies via internet).<br>
There are various success stories and large companies are increasingly investing in this success. According to Porter (2001), the Internet is the IT tool that,
up to the present, has shown the greatest potential of being a factor in obtaining
strategic advantages. This matter is explored in the chapter on the New
Economy.<br>
Within this scenario, an appropriate analysis and evaluation of IT effectiveness
can take on a fundamental role, enabling it to really become a powerful tool for
competitiveness.<br>
            
            
            
           <h3><b> Case Studies: Strategy and
               Decisions in Perspective</b></h3><hr>
            <h4><b>Case – IT is Worth its Weight in Results</b></h4><hr><br>
According to the 2003 reports from the Federal Reserve, the US central bank,
software sales in the United States rose just 6% in 2002, after a drop of 3% in
2001. For the Gartner Group, which researches the IT sector, a 4.9% increase
in demand for products and services for this sector was predicted for 2003, but
the majority of expenditures in new projects will only take place if a return on
these investments can be demonstrated.<br>
In this analysis of investments in IT, these studies shows that companies use
financial indicators such as the ROI (return on investment) and TCO (total cost
of ownership). In a simplified way, the ROI measures financial returns on
investments undertaken, while the TCO lists the direct and indirect costs of a
product or service. However, calculating these indicators for IT projects is not
an easy task.<br>
Meanwhile, a study of large companies in Brazil by the Grupo IT Mídia,
indicated that 59% of the executives declared their intention to increase
investment in IT in 2003. But 46% of the amounts that will be applied include
the intention to realize immediate returns.<br>
For example, Ásia Shipping, which is in the business of marine freight
transportation, invested R$250 thousand between 2001 and 2002 to modernize its IT infrastructure, and significantly reduced its costs. Among the IT
applications were rapid connections via Internet of its offices in São Paulo,
Santos (SP), Paranaguá (PR), and Vitória (ES) and the ability of clients to
monitor their shipments.<br>
Another example is the adoption by Siemen’s Brazilian affiliate of a single
standard operational system to facilitate technical support involved an investment of R$3 million, which was paid off in one year of operation.<br>
Meanwhile, Industil, a paint manufacturing industry in the eastern region of the
city of São Paulo, invested R$35 thousand to install rapid Internet and e-mail
accounts for its employees and a new network, and experienced large cost
reductions with improvements in the security of data critical to the company and
the elimination of paper correspondence.<br>
Portal Agência Estado, February 17, 2003<br><br><br>
            
            
            
            <h4><b>Case – Between Trucks and Refrigerators, Computers</b></h4><hr><br>
Casas Bahia, the major retail outlet for household appliances in Brazil, is known
for selling at low prices to a low-income public and for not being on the Internet;
the site only provides general information such as store addresses and contains
nothing of electronic commerce.<br>
However, within its culture of divestment and pragmatism, IT has guaranteed
its place in the company and the results have been very positive. And both the
space and the results are appreciable. One indication is the fact that Casas Bahia
is one of the three largest among IBM’s retail and consumer goods clients.<br>
An integrated management system allows the company managers to accompany daily sales by type of product and daily invoicing by store. Until now, the
lack of the Internet has been premeditated and is due to the fact that its lowincome clients do not have Internet access.<br>
However, since credit service is the key to its operations since sales on credit
make up 90% of the total, Casas Bahia has invested in a complex and
sophisticated system of business intelligence which can analyze the company’s
database to find patterns not evident at first glance. This is a new and expensive
technology that incorporates elements of artificial intelligence.<br>
In this way, clients with a higher probability for payment default (about 6% of
annual billing of 3.6 billion reais in 2001) can be identified.<br>
Significant investments (around 7 million reais) were made in modernizing the
data network. With this, all the stores and warehouses became linked to an
intranet that transmits both voice and data traffic six times quicker.
Thanks to this network, management can monitor all the company’s operations
from its headquarters in São Caetano do Sul, in the ABC region of São Paulo.<br>
Another critical point where IT has made an important contribution is to
logistics. In 1995, an enormous investment was made in a gigantic 170
thousand square meter distribution center in Jundiaí, São Paulo where more
than 1.2 million items from eight states arrived, destined to 24,000 different
addresses. The IT logistical system is integrated into the purchasing and sales
system and product entry and exit is controlled by bar code. The extension of
integration from sales to delivery is contemplated. Once the sale is concluded,
this system allows merchandise to be located in the warehouse and cleared, and
the truck route to deliver the product is elaborated automatically. Thus the client
can be informed of the exact delivery date at the time of purchase.   
            
          The company’s IT team is comprised of approximately 100 people and
performs all operations internally, from developing the payroll system to
providing support to computers in the stores. The policy of not outsourcing is
characteristic of the company. Note that all the logistics are also internally
operated. The company has, for example, a team of 1,000 drivers.<br>
Adapted from Revista Exame, 03/06/2002 and Portal Exame, 03/04/2002.<br><br>
            <h4><b>Case – IT is Highlighted in Four Different Situations</b></h4><hr><br><br>
The following four situations in companies active in Brazil demonstrate different
possibilities for using IT and its impact on strategies: CTBC Telecom, Bunge
Fertilizer, Siemens and Michelin.<br><br><br>
            <p class="p1">CTBC Telecom</p><hr>
At the end of 2000, CTBC Telecom, a telephone operator which serves the
states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul and Goiás, included
the improvement of the indices of customer satisfaction in its strategy. Its
importance was emphasized by tying the annual bonuses to it. Feeling a lack of
good IT application support that would collaborate to this end, it decided to
invest in a CRM project at the end of 2000. In its first phase, the project cost
24 million reais, but the results were promising.<br><br>
Before CRM, when clients asked for information, they had to wait while an
attendant looked up the necessary information in eight different databases
(main records, service orders, billing, directory assistance, etc.) After the
implantation of the initial phase, five of these systems were merged; there was
a 30% average reduction in response time and customer satisfaction surveys
showed signs of improvement. All the annual bonuses were paid.<br><br>
            <p class="p1">Bunge Fertilizantes</p><hr><br><br>
Bunge Fertilizers, which belongs to the Bunge group (discussed earlier in this
book), billed one billion dollars in 2001. The company was the result of a
merger of five fertilizer manufacturers, only one of which had an ERP system.
There was a need to integrate all their IT systems, so that there would be
adequate, precise, and rapid information about all 63 units of the company  
            
            
            
           
            available to headquarters in São Paulo. This was crucial for the success of its
business plan.
According to a company executive, the director of technology and strategic
planning, “technology was a result of a company necessity.”
            <p class="p1">Siemens</p><hr><br>
At Siemens of Brazil, there are only nine people on the IT team, which includes
business analysts, technical experts, and process analysts to care for the design
and definition of business needs. This was possible due to a company decision
to heavily outsource its IT services, for which Siemens Business Service was
created. This latter is a separate organization that is responsible for the German
conglomerate’s infrastructure worldwide, which made it possible for IT costs
to fall from 3% to 2% of billing.<br>
According to International Data Corporation (IDC), a market research company, in 2001 Brazilian companies paid 663 million dollars to outsourcing
companies to operate their IT areas, in addition to more than 95 million to rent
the use of applications. CPAM, of São Paulo, one of the largest Brazilian IT
firms, billed 473 million reais in 2001, 21% over what it had billed in 2000.
Two-thirds was for service delivery, and one-third was for the commercialization of equipment and programs.<br>
However, there are not just positive aspects to the outsourcing of IT (such as
cost reduction). Among other risks, there is the possibility that service
providers go bankrupt and leave their clients without coverage.<br><br>
            <p class="p1">Michelin</p><hr><br>
Michelin of Brazil, a tire manufacturer, successfully implanted its integrated
CRM, a customer relations system that involves several of the company’s
departments. The project, which was undertaken in February 2001 with an
investment of 800 thousand dollars and an expected return on investment
timeline of two years, is continuing on schedule within the time and cost
guidelines. The system will be expanded to other countries in Latin America,
which could generate an economy of scale for use of the technology and expand
the integration of information.<br>
These good project results are due in large part to the way the implantation team was
put together and led; it has professionals from the areas of business, IT, and marketing
            
            
            
          Initially in 1999, the decision to implant a CRM was due to the need to improve
the service provided by the company’s call center, which served the company’s
distributors and sales personnel in the field, who phoned in with questions,
requests for information, and to place orders for merchandise.<br>
With the installation of a factory in São Paulo and the resulting increase in the
number of distributors (from 80 in 1995 to 200 in 1999), the call center could
not handle the job. Thus CRM computerized the service.<br>
But the CRM allowed the company to go beyond resolving this operational
problem. This IT application lent support for developing new initiatives
including new strategies in the areas of e-business and sales.<br>
Beginning in 2000, each salesperson was given a laptop with access to
company information available in an intranet. With this, the need for integration
among data received by the call center and the sales forces was perceived, due
to the redundancy of answering the same questions from sales personnel. The new
integrated system eliminated this problem, in addition to providing automatic
answers to requests and questions and this improved the company’s image.<br>
Later, a network with information about the company was implanted which was
accessible even by employees. Orders no longer needed to be written down by
sales personnel, who could then act as consultants.<br>
The integration of this system permitted the company to visualize other areas
that synchronize with data collected by the call center and the Internet, among
these are the areas of logistics and the billing and marketing departments. With
its reformulated information system, the internal areas could assume a performance commitment to one another, which led to a tangible improvement in the
quality of customer service.<br>

            <h3><b>Questions for Reflection and Discussion</b></h3><hr><br><br>
Considering the case in the section titled IT is Worth it’s Weight in Results,
